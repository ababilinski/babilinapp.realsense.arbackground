# AR Background for RealSense URP

This package contains all the required components to update the RealSense AR Background Demo to Unity's Universal Render Pipeline. 

I just started experimenting with shaders and the Scriptable Render Pipeline so there are probably optimizations that can be made. 

If you find this package helpful and find a better way to add shadows to the AR object, please make a pull request ðŸ™‚
